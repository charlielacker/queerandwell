            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>What services do you offer as a coach?</h4>
                    <p>I offer personalized wellness plans, habit development, and assistance with overall wellness practices. We can work together long-term or develop a short-term plan of action. I can be flexible to suit your needs!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>How can I schedule a session with you?</h4>
                    <p>Navigate to the Contact page and send me an email, or use the Let's Go button above! I'll get back to you as soon as possible to discuss availability.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>What's the difference between coaching and personal training?</h4>
                    <p>They're pretty similar, and are often used interchangeably, but I use the term Coaching specifically to avoid the negative connotations attached to personal training, as well as to emphasize the focus on the whole person.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Can I use health insurance to pay for sessions?</h4>
                    <p>Unfortunately, no. However, I do offer a sliding scale payment system to help make my services more accessible to those who may not typically be able to access them. Check out the Services page for more information, or contact me directly with questions!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>I don't have a gym membership, can I still benefit from coaching?</h4>
                    <p>Absolutely! Most wellness plans don't focus solely on gym exercises and can be tailored to fit your situation. No equipment, no problem!</p>
