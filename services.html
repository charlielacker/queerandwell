            <p>I offer a sliding scale payment system based mainly on income, with some other considerations available. Please read the options carefully and choose the tier that is most appropriate for your situation. Choosing a higher tier, when able, helps to support those in lower tiers. If you're not sure, or you feel that you fall in between tiers, please let me know.</p>
