            <h2>Pricing</h2>
            <p class="description">I offer a sliding scale payment system based mainly on income, with some other considerations available. Below, you'll find a pricing example for weekly virtual meetings with a wellness plan for exercise and habit development. Pricing will differ depending on how you'd like to set up your coaching experience! Choosing a higher tier, when able, helps to support those in lower tiers. Following your free consultation, I'll provide you with more accurate pricing information.</p>
